        <ul>
          <li>Candidates should reach out to the CALA Executive Committee (EC) by the end of January in the year they
            seek election if they are running for President within the American Library Association (ALA) and within the
            International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).</li>
          <li>Each person seeking an endorsement for ALA president should send the CALA EC a short biography,
            political/platform statement, resume/CV and be open to do a virtual interview with all CALA members via an
            online program like Zoom or Google Meet. All other candidates seeking endorsement for other
            offices/committees can send a resume/CV and a short biographical statement to the CALA EC.</li>
          <li>CALA EC will make the decision/vote for endorsement. To gain an endorsement, a candidate must get the
            majority vote from CALA EC.</li>
          <li>Endorsements are given out on a voluntary/non-monetary basis and it is not mandatory that an endorsement
            is given every year. Endorsements are awarded at the discretion of CALA EC. If CALA EC does not find any
            candidates worthy of a political endorsement, they can decide not to endorse any political candidates in a
            given year.</li>
          <li>Generally, CALA EC has only endorsed candidates for ALA President and IFLA President and Governing Board
            Members. CALA EC is open to endorsing candidates running for other types of library/information
            science/archives-related offices, excluding CALA election, union elections and cases where people in
            academic positions seek individual tenure.</li>
          <li>If anyone seeking an endorsement is (1) part of the CALA EC, or (2) have conflict of interest with any of
            the candidates (relative, romantic or business partner, supervisor/employee, etc.),  that person must recuse
            themselves from the endorsement discussion and vote.</li>
          <li>Any other non-library/information science/archive related political offices (such as state and municipal
            government races, Board of Education, academic tenure, etc.) or political offices related to our fellow
            national associations of librarians of color (the Black Caucus of the American Librarians Association/BCALA;
            REFORMA: The National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish
            Speaking; the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association; the American Indian Library Association/AILA)
            and/or the Joint Council of Librarians of Color (JCLC), will not be under consideration for CALA
            endorsement.</li>
          <li>It is not mandatory for political candidates to be CALA members to seek the organizations’ endorsement,
            however membership and service to the organization would be seen favorably.</li>
          <li>Once the CALA EC gets the names of political candidates who are running for office and seeking CALA
            endorsement, the CALA President will verify  the list of names  with  the CALA Membership Committee to
            confirm membership status of the candidates.</li>
          <li>Endorsement will be a public statement of support from CALA via a press release that will be posted on the
            CALA website and social media channels. There are no monetary campaign contributions or volunteer campaign
            work associated with an endorsement. CALA EC will write and publish the press release.</li>
          <li>Individual CALA members who wish to contribute their own volunteer time and funds to a political campaign
            may do so as long as they do not imply they are acting as an official representative/or on behalf of CALA.
          </li>
          <li>Ideally, CALA EC will make their political endorsement announcement by the end of February or early March
            for the ALA presidential race. Announcements of endorsement for other political offices will be determined
            by CALA EC depending on the election timeline of the other political races.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h6">Minimum candidate standard requirements:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be running for office within the American Library Association or related affiliates. Other
            library/information science/archive-related political elections would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
          </li>
          <li>Agree with CALA’s mission and vision and candidates must state how they are supporting/doing the work in
            their candidate statement and interview.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate commitment/support for the Chinese and Chinese American communities and Asian American and 
            Pacific Islander communities at large. Candidates do not necessarily have to be of Chinese heritage.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate commitment/support for diversity at large within the library/ information science/archives
            profession.</li>
          <li>For candidates seeking ALA presidential office, they must demonstrate a strong background  of  leadership
            and management experience.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate integrity, character and good communication skills.</li>
          <li>Active volunteering/involvement in other library/information science/archives-related groups or civic and
            community organizations, or diverse/multicultural institutions or organizations will be looked at favorably.

        <p class="text-end">Approved April 3, 2018, by the Board of Directors</p>
        <p class="text-end"><strong>Last Updated: May 19, 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this CALA Code of Conduct is to establish a culture of professional, courteous, respectful, and inclusive communication among all participants on all online platforms including social media (Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn) used by CALA. We are each responsible for the content we post on these platforms. (This Code of Conduct complements the <a href="https://2021.alaannual.org/general-information/ala-virtual-meeting-code-conduct">ALA Virtual Meeting Code of Conduct</a>, which applies to professional conferences and meetings held by ALA.) CALA also has a Listserv Policy, <a href="https://retired.cala-web.org/files/docs/CALA-listserv-policy-v.2022.7.22.pdf">see here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>
<p>Harassment is unacceptable and includes, though is not limited to, comments, non-verbal expressions, or imagery that demeans or disparages a person or group based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>race, ethnicity, or native language</li>
<li>sex, gender, gender identity or expression</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>sexual orientation</li>
<li>physical or mental disability</li>
<li>physical appearance, body size, or presentation</li>
<li>age</li>
<li>religious or political beliefs, including lack of religious beliefs</li>
<li>marital or family status</li>
<li>nationality, citizenship status, or geographic location</li>
<li>employment or military status</li>
<li>socioeconomic status</li>
</ul>
<p>Posts featuring sexual, violent, or discriminatory content are prohibited.</p>
<p>Intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, inappropriate physical or virtual contact, or unwelcome attention, including sexual attention are not permitted.</p>
<p>Respect intellectual property and give credit where it is due. It is the user&rsquo;s responsibility to obtain permission for any material they post that is not their own. Please include copyright notices where appropriate, ask for creator information where unknown, and be prepared to include credits if they are found after you post.<br /><br />No endorsement or any promotion of any local, state, or federal candidates for political office is allowed. Neither is encouraging boycotts. These limits are because of IRS restrictions for tax-exempt organizations; detailed information can be found on the <a href="http://www.ala.org/aboutala/governance/legalguidelines/legalframework/alalegalframework">ALA Legal Framework page</a>.<br /><br />Promotion of paid products, events, or services not initiated by the Chinese American Librarians Association is not allowed. CALA is an affiliate of the American Library Association (ALA) and follows ALA practices. We encourage the sharing of nonpaid opportunities that may benefit the community. However, we ask that you do not spam. Be conscious of the number of times that you share the same opportunity and be thoughtful of the number of communities where this information is shared. When sharing your opportunity, we ask that you not just aim for reach within our community but also seek to ensure that your opportunity matches the specific needs of that community&rsquo;s members.</p>
<p>Post as yourself. Do not impersonate any other people or entities that you are not affiliated with.</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foster useful and dynamic discussions and engage in a respectful dialogue. Accept critique and offer it constructively; approach discussions with an open mind and be willing to learn. Thousands of people may eventually see the messages you post, which may stay online in perpetuity and be seen by colleagues, employers, and patrons alike.</p>
<p>Respect freedom of expression. We encourage spirited discussion and debate. Disagreeing with an idea is different from attacking an individual, especially since discussion topics can sometimes be challenging. We encourage genuine inquiry that can build trusting relationships and a safe, respectful, and supportive environment, even in times of complex change. Every member is on an individual journey of education and understanding, and should communicate candidly and respectfully about difficult topics. Be willing to acknowledge privileges and to learn from the community.</p>
<p>Consider and take responsibility for the impact of communications. Impact matters more than intent, especially when the absence of nonverbal cues or voice tone means that statements (humor in particular) can easily be interpreted as aggressive or negative.</p>
<p>Listen as much as you share and remember that other participants may have expertise you are unaware of. Make sure conversations are inclusive, and practice active listening.</p>
<p>When you see content that is problematic, you may address it either publicly or privately. Acknowledge that your response is part of a respectful discussion. Pointing out factually erroneous or offensive comments keeps the space safe and helps build a stronger community. These are opportunities to educate &ndash; and to learn. In addition, if conversations continue and become out of scope or topic, please take the conversation offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speak from your own experience and avoid making generalizations. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether something is correct, you can ask the community for resources.</p>
<p>Respect other people's pronouns &ndash; often seen in their profile or signature &ndash; preferred names, and forms of address. Consider using gender-neutral collective nouns/pronouns when addressing groups. For example, try &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; or &ldquo;folks&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Share inspiring content. You are encouraged to share content that uplifts and explores the profession. For instance, news stories about events, examples of successful library programming, and strategies for troubleshooting are appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE TO GO FOR HELP</strong></p>
<p>If you think you have seen activity that violates the letter or the spirit of this Code of Conduct, please alert our CALA social media subcommittee at <a href="mailto:smedia@calaweb.org">smedia@calaweb.org</a> or CALA Executive Committee: <a href="mailto:exc@cala-web.org">exc@cala-web.org</a> or members of the CALA Executive Committee directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonymous reports are allowed. Please note that anonymous reporting may limit moderators&rsquo; ability to fully respond to conflicts, particularly if it prevents follow-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>Moderators will reach out to both the user reporting the incident and the user reported upon, but confidentiality may prevent moderators from sharing details of an issue&rsquo;s resolution. Moderators may delete content that violates the Code of Conduct and in extreme cases may temporarily suspend access for violators prior to making a decision about an incident. The severity of the offense will dictate the ramifications including full suspension from a platform or platforms.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct will be used equitably. Different situations will require different resolutions; moderators will give significant weight to context and impact when making decisions. They will strive to prioritize accountability and depending on the wishes of the individuals involved in an incident. If violators are suspended, the length of the suspension will be clearly described in writing.</p>
<p>Anyone involved in an incident may appeal a decision by sending an email to the CALA Executive Committee: <a href="mailto:exc@cala-web.org">exc@cala-web.org</a>. Appeals must be submitted within 60 days of the date the moderators&rsquo; decision was communicated, and must describe the reason for the appeal and why the decision should be changed. The CALA Executive Committee will oversee the appeal process.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>CALA members should strive to maintain a civil atmosphere at all times when interacting with each other and in all communications. All types of communication must refrain from shouting, yelling, using abusive languages at other CALA members or officers.</li>
          <li>CALA members should show respect to every other person in the organization. Courtesy, tact and consideration should lead  each member’s communication and interaction with members both in person and online including emails.</li>

          CALA Endowment Fund is to secure CALA and its future operation. The CALA $100,000
          endowment fund will be invested into a carefully selected mutual fund approved by EC and
          Board. In any good year, 5% of the earnings will be reinvested into the principal. The 5%
          reinvestment to the principal is to keep the fund with the inflation and with the fluctuation of
          the market, especially for any year that has a downside. The remaining earnings can be used for
          operation or scholarship use. This is recommended according to literature regarding
          endowment funds managed by non-profit organization. The bank should be instructed to return
          the 5% of the earnings into the principal and the remaining earnings into a separate account.
          This account can be cash reserve or the same mutual fund.

        <p class="text-end">Amended June 24, 2018, by the Board of Directors</p>
        <p>The Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA, <a href="https://cala-web.org">https://cala-web.org</a>),
          a non-profit organization with 501(c)3 tax exempt status, recognizes the importance of maintaining a healthy
          status both strategically and financially. This policy establishes a general investment guideline for the
          relevant endowment funds that are used to support CALA’s operational and awarding activities.</p>
        <p>The Board of Directors has a direct oversight role regarding all decisions that impact CALA’s organizational
          funds. The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors (EC) is entitled by the CALA Constitution to possess
          all authority of the Board to act between board meetings, except with respect to the following three matters –
          (1) actions requiring general membership approval, (2) amendment or repeal of any portion of the Bylaws, and
          (3) amendment of any resolution of the Board unless so authorized by the Board. EC has the delegated
          supervisory responsibility for the management of CALA funds.</p>
        <p>In accordance with CALA’s understanding and support of Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds
          Act<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> (UPMIFA), investment decisions must be
          considered along with the status and mandate of CALA. The investments will preserve the purchasing power of
          the principal of the endowment funds in the future.&nbsp; The Executive Committee shall manage and invest
          CALA’s funds in good faith and with the care that an ordinarily prudent body in a like position would exercise
          under similar circumstances. In making decisions relative to the investment of organizational funds, each of
          the following factors must be considered:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>general economic conditions;</li>
          <li>possible effect of inflation or deflation;</li>
          <li>expected tax consequences, if any, of investment decisions or strategies;</li>
          <li>diversified portfolio of investment options;</li>
          <li>expected total return from the income and appreciation of investments;</li>
          <li>the needs of the organization and the fund to make distributions and preserve capital; and,</li>
          <li>an asset’s special relationship or special value, if any, to the organization’s purposes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For each decision to do with appropriate organizational funds for investment or expenditure, a written
          approval record by the EC and Board of Directors shall be kept and maintained describing the investment
          proposal, discussion, and the voting results, including voting members and date.</p>

        <p>When any such interest become relevant to any subject requiring action by the Board of Directors or any of
          its committees, the Board member having a conflict shall call it to the attention of the Board or the
          committees. The Board member shall not vote on the subject in which the member has a conflict of interest;
          shall not use personal influence; and in those cases where the quorum of the meeting is called for the purpose
          of voting on the subject has not been established, the Board member shall not be counted.</p>
        <p>If excluded from voting because of a conflict of interest, the Board member will be required to briefly state
          the nature of the conflict, and may be requested to answer pertinent questions of other Board members when
          that Board member’s knowledge of the subject will assist the Board or any of its committees. The Board may
          request that a Board member thus excluded from voting on a subject leave the meeting temporarily while the
          subject is debated and voted upon. The minutes of the meeting shall reflect that a disclosure was made, that
          the Board member who stated a conflict of interest did abstain from voting, and, in those cases where the
          quorum was not already established, that the Board member was not counted in determining the quorum.</p>
        <p>Unless specified excluded by an award, election, or grant, all members defined under “eligibility” shall be
          permitted to apply. If nominated as a candidate, a voting member should recuse oneself following
          aforementioned protocols.</p>
        <p>In addition, if any Board member, who by reason of his or her institutional affiliation or any other
          pertinent matter, anticipates that in the future certain issues to be placed before the Board may place him or
          her in a position of conflict of interest, the Board member shall disclose such conflict in writing to the
          Board and make it a matter of record.</p>

          <li><strong>CALA Donation Acceptance Policy</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA,&nbsp;<a
            href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201201025016/https://cala-web.org/"
            style="color: rgb(0, 113, 179); text-decoration-line: none;">https://cala-web.org</a>), a non-profit
          organization with 501(c)3 tax exempt status, appreciates the valuable donations made by CALA members and
          supporters in developing CALA as an organization and enhancing members’ professional growth and development
          in the short- and long-terms.</p>
        <p>As CALA has demonstrated in its remarkable history of &nbsp;47 years, income from monetary donations
          represents an important and growing source of funding for the association. As such, the establishment of
          donation funds should reflect and be driven by the strategic priorities of CALA defined by the CALA
          Strategic Plan (2020-2025) and support CALA programs and services. CALA has the responsibility to properly
          manage and use donated funds as intended by the donors, and to report to donors or designated contacts on
          the impact of their donations within CALA and the Library and Information Science (LIS) field.</p>
        <p>This policy pertains to CALA. The purpose of this donation acceptance and management policy is to govern
          CALA’s acceptance of donations and manage donors’ expectations. The policy provides guidance to donors and
          their professional advisors in completing donations. It also provides guidance to the CALA Board, the
          Fundraising/Public Relations Committee, the Finance Committee, gift fund award committees, and CALA
          members.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Donors are advised to follow the policy and seek independent legal or tax counsel when making a donation to
          CALA. CALA may engage legal or tax counsel to assist with the donation as needed and appropriate.</p>
        <p><strong>General Policy and Guidelines</strong></p>
        <p>Acceptance of donations is based on the relevance and consistency with the purpose and mission of CALA (<a

            style="color: rgb(0, 113, 179); text-decoration-line: none;">https://cala-web.org/constitution</a>), and
          CALA Bylaws (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201201025016/http://cala-web.org/bylaws"
            style="color: rgb(0, 113, 179); text-decoration-line: none;">https://cala-web.org/bylaws</a>). Donations
          which are contrary to or beyond the scope of CALA’s mission and purpose will be rejected.&nbsp; CALA
          reserves the sole and absolute right to determine whether to accept or reject a donation.</p>
        <p>All donations to CALA, once established and received, are irrevocable and non-transferrable, and become the
          property of CALA, and will be administered by CALA.</p>
        <p>Generally, CALA accepts two categories of cash or check donations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Current Use Fund:</strong>&nbsp;A donor may make donations to CALA and the fund will be used
            until it's exhausted. The fund may be an unrestricted, allowing CALA the flexibility to support its most
            pressing and strategic needs, or it may be restricted to meet the donor's specific intent. The donor may
            also choose to designate donations to an existing fund.&nbsp; Currently CALA has the following active
            funds:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>CALA Caring and Loving Fund</li>

          <li>Outstanding Library Leadership Award in Memory of Dr. Margaret Chang Fung</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to establish a named fund, the minimal is&nbsp;<strong>$10,000 (USD</strong>). Please consult the
          web page of&nbsp;<u>CALA Donations and Contributions</u>&nbsp;(<a
            href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201201025016/http://cala-web.org/donate"
            style="color: rgb(0, 113, 179); text-decoration-line: none;">https://cala-web.org/donate</a><u>)</u>.&nbsp;
          Unless specifically directed otherwise, donations shall be regarded as unrestricted.&nbsp; CALA reserves the
          right to establish additional funds, fund/donation agreements, or donation restrictions on a per-donation
          basis.</p>
        <p><strong>(2) Endowment Fund:&nbsp;</strong>Endowment Fund donations are contributions with donor-specified
          restrictions that the principal be invested in perpetuity (subject to certain limitations).&nbsp; In
          addition, income (e.g., interest, dividend) from those investments may also be restricted by donors (see
          reference at&nbsp;<a
            href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201201025016/https://cala-web.org/endowment-fund-policy"
            style="color: rgb(0, 113, 179); text-decoration-line: none;">https://cala-web.org/endowment-fund-policy</a>).
        </p>
        <p>CALA requires a minimum&nbsp;<strong>$50,000 (USD)</strong>&nbsp;gift from a donor to establish an
          endowment fund. The donation can be phased in multiple years. The endowment funds may be named in honor or
          in memory of individual(s) as determined by the donor, in consultation with the CALA President and the CALA
          Executive Director.</p>
        <p>The endowment fund would adhere to the outlined purpose provided by the donor, or as prescribed in an
          applicable endowment fund agreement. To ensure that the donor’s intent is met and the use can be
          administered, the CALA President and the CALA Executive Director must work alongside the donor to prepare a
          fund agreement that will govern the endowment.&nbsp; The agreement shall govern CALA and shall be consistent
          with CALA’s Constitution and Bylaws. The agreement shall also be governed by and interpreted in accordance
          with all applicable Federal and state laws.&nbsp; The agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the CALA
          Executive Committee of the Board, and signed by the donor, the CALA President and the CALA Executive
          Director.</p>
        <p>An endowment fund will not be in effect until a fully executed fund agreement is in place and the following
          conditions are met:&nbsp; CALA has the entire amount of the endowment in hand and available for support for
          the purpose designated in the gift agreement.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the following guidelines shall apply to all endowment
          funds and endowment fund agreements.&nbsp; Until the fund balance reaches the minimum funding level of
          $50,000 (USD), the spending allowance will be reinvested into principal (fund balance).&nbsp; The “fund
          balance" or "principal" represents the funds originally gifted by the donor, adjusted by any capital
          appreciation or depreciation, and it may also include some permanently reinvested income. The market value
          is also referred to as "net asset value"; it represents the value of the individual fund's investment in the
          designated funds at a specified date (see reference at&nbsp;<a
            href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201201025016/https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/endowments"
            style="color: rgb(0, 113, 179); text-decoration-line: none;">https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/endowments</a>).
          Upon request, the CALA Treasurer, informing the CALA Executive Committee of the Board and the CALA Board,
          will prepare an annual statement of endowment fund activity and growth for the donor and/or designated
          contact person. The Treasurer will also prepare an annual budget for the related gift fund committees,
          informing the CALA Executive Committee of the Board and the CALA Board.</p>
        <p>Any changes and updates to the endowed gift fund purpose or designation will require an amendment to the
          original governing document, signed by CALA president and executive director on behalf of CALA EC and the
          donor or the donor's representative or successor in interest.</p>
        <p>CALA adheres to ethical standards and adopts the Model Standards of Practice for the Charitable Planner (<a
            href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201201025016/https://charitablegiftplanners.org/standards/model-standards-practice-charitable-gift-planner"

          promoted by the National Association of Charitable Gift Planners).</p>
        <p>The Donation Acceptance and Management Policy will be reviewed by the CALA Board annually to determine if
          any amendments are needed to reflect changes in law and/or CALA and to address new situations not previously
          addressed by the policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>

          <li><strong>CALA Donation Management Policy</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>A gift fund donated to CALA will be invested in a prudent and diversified manner to produce a reasonable
          total annual return, with the assistance of a qualified investment advisor, and with approval from the Board
          of Directors of CALA.&nbsp; The fund may be commingled with other CALA investments for investment purposes,
          but CALA shall maintain in its books a separate record showing the individual fund’s proportionate share of
          gain, loss, income, and expenses, including common investment expenses such as a proportionate share of any
          advisor fees and other investment expenses.&nbsp; CALA shall keep the donor advised of the investment
          performance of the fund, not less than annually, at the donor’s request.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The CALA award committee for a gift fund has no role in the gift fund management, but will be kept informed
          by the CALA Treasurer of the fund balance and the available amount of the award upon request. The donor may
          serve on the award committee as an Ex Officio who cannot vote or make decisions on the award. The donor will
          be kept informed by the award committee about the award selection process.</p>

        <p>The Chinese American Librarians Association

          501(c)3
          tax exempt status aims to support CALA members and supporters in developing CALA as an organization and
          enhancing members’ professional growth and development in the short- and long-terms.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this
          donation-giving /sponsorship policy is to govern CALA’s donating/sponsorship process.&nbsp; The policy
          provides guidance to CALA when it comes to donating or sponsoring for specific or general causes. It also
          provides guidance to the CALA Board, the Fundraising/Public Relations Committee, and CALA
          members.</p>
        <p>Not to be confused with
          the CALA<a href="https://www.cala-web.org/donation/policy">Donation Acceptance and Management
            Policy</a>, this policy
          focuses on external requests for CALA’s monetary donations or sponsorships on non-CALA activities.</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>General Policy and Guidelines</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>All requests for CALA to donate or to sponsor a non-CALA activity
              will be discussed and voted on by the&nbsp; CALA Executive Committee (EC).&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>CALA Chapters and its leadership can decide to donate/sponsor
              independently from CALA EC. If a Chapter has decided to sponsor or donate to a request, CALA EC is not
              required to donate/sponsor the same request in order to avoid duplications.&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Requests can be specific or general causes/sponsorships (e.g. ALA
              Emerging Leaders Program or JCLC conferences)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Requests should connect to CALA’s mission, values, and support its
              members</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Requests must be free of conflict of interest. (e.g. According to ALA,
              “a<a href="https://www.ala.org/tools/ethics/conflictsofinterestqa#123">
                conflict of
                interest</a>
              involves
              circumstances where an individual's professional actions or decisions at the [association] could be
              influenced by considerations of personal gain, usually of a financial nature, as a result of interests
              outside their [association] responsibilities.”)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Requests should be related to the library and information sciences
              (LIS) profession.&nbsp;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Once a decision has been made, CALA EC will inform all parties
              involved. At any point, CALA can rescind its decision to donate or to sponsor</p>

        <p class="text-end">(approved January 15, 2000; revised July 8, 2000)</p>
        <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
        <p>This document prescribes the procedure for financial reporting within CALA. In addition to general
          finance-related information, it includes specific procedures for 1) the Treasurer and Treasurer's quarterly
          reports, 2) Budget, 3) Bank account and check processing, 4) the request form for fund appropriation or
          reimbursement, 5) special funds, and 6) the Finance Committee and its reports.</p>
        <p><strong>Fiscal and tax year</strong></p>
        <p>CALA uses the calendar year (January 1 to December 31) as its fiscal year as well as its tax year for its
          accounting period. The Treasurer files the appropriate form stated below for its income tax return by May 15
          of the year as needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Tax exempt status</strong></p>
        <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS; website: <a href="http://www.irs.gov">www.irs.gov</a>) issued an advance
          ruling on September 19, 1997 to recognize the Association as a nonprofit organization described in section
          501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Association's Employer Identification Number (EIN) is 23-7417422.
          The ruling took effect retroactively on September 6, 1996, and will end on December 31, 2000. Within 90 days
          after December 31, 2000, the Treasurer shall submit, upon IRS request, a completed Form 8734 covering gross
          revenues statements from September 1996 to December 2000 in order to obtain the permanent status.</p>
        <p>The Treasurer shall determine annually whether CALA is required to file Form 990 or Form 990-EZ, Return of
          Organization Exempt from Income Tax. Normally, when the gross receipts are not more than $25,000, an
          organization needs not to file a return with the IRS. In determining whether CALA shall file Form 990 (or
          990-EZ), the Treasurer shall include into calculation gross revenues reported by all Chapters which use CALA
          EIN for their bank accounts.</p>
        <p>1. The Treasurer and Treasurer's Quarterly Reports</p>
        <p>The Treasurer is accountable to the Board regarding every aspect of the Association's finance. The
          Treasurer's quarterly reports shall consist of a) a financial transaction ledger, and b) a revenue and expense
          statement with items categorized in accordance with the categories used on the CALA Request Form for Fund
          Appropriation or Reimbursement. The Treasurer's annual report shall consist of the above two and c) a formal
          balance sheet.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Financial transaction ledger: It shows each and every transaction that occurs in an account. It lists in
            columns by date, check number, payee/payer, description, payment amount, clear, deposit amount, and balance.
            It is used to compare with the bank monthly statement to ensure that the two have exactly the same ending
            balance and to check off on the ledger all transactions that have been posted in the bank monthly
            statement.<br>
            An example of financial transaction ledger is included in Appendix A.
          </li>
          <li>Revenue and expense statement: It gives income and expense amounts arranged in categories within a
            particular period of time. An example of a revenue and expense statement is included in Appendix B.
          </li>
          <li>Balance sheet: It shows the Association's financial status (i.e., asset and liability). It is called a
            balance sheet because the net total of assets shall always be exactly the same as that of liabilities. A
            balance sheet shall be done at the end of the financial reporting year.<br>
            An example of a balance sheet is included in Appendix C.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Treasurer shall submit treasurer's report on a quarterly basis (July/Aug./Sept., Oct./Nov./Dec.,
          Jan./Feb./Mar., April/May/June) within 30 days after the quarter ends. Each quarterly report shall be
          submitted to the Finance Committee with copies to the Executive Committee.</p>
        <p>Both the September and December quarterly reports shall be available for all Board members prior to the
          mid-winter meeting. December report (also called mid-winter report) shall cover all days in December to two
          weeks before the mid-winter meeting. Both the March and June reports shall be available for all Board members
          prior to the annual meeting. The June report (also called annual report) shall cover all days in June up to
          the two weeks before the annual meeting. The remaining days of June shall be covered in the following
          quarterly report. These reports are also to be used for IRS purposes.</p>
        <p>2. Budget</p>
        <p>CALA budget year is the same as financial report year that runs from July 1 to June 30. All requests for
          payment must be submitted by July 31 following the budget year.</p>
        <p>The current Executive Committee shall prepare the annual budget in spring for the following activity year.
          Even though the current President, being the chair of the Executive Committee, initiates the process, the
          President-Elect plays the largest role in preparing this budget since the budget is for the year when the
          President-Elect will be the President. The Executive Committee then submits the draft to the current Board for
          input and discussion (but not voting) at the first Board meeting of the annual conference. The new Board at
          the second Board meeting of the annual conference then approves the revised budget.</p>
        <p>The Treasurer is authorized to issue checks for expense items approved as part of the annual budget; examples
          of such expense items include:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Membership rebate<br>
            Newsletter and journal mailing<br>
            General postage</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Board shall approve any expenditure item not included in the budget before any payment is made.</p>
        <p>Note: The journal editor's responsibility as stated in the Bylaws (Section 5) is not subject to these
          guidelines.</p>
        <p>3. Bank account and check processing</p>
        <p>When it is necessary to establish a bank account, the name of the bank account(s) shall be "Chinese American
          Librarians Association." All CALA checks shall be properly endorsed or legibly printed.</p>
        <p>Request Form for Fund Appropriation or Reimbursement (FAR)</p>
        <p>4. The Request Form for FAR is available on the CALA Web page: <a
            href="http://www.cala-web.org">http://www.cala-web.org</a> The form shall be completed with original
          receipt(s) or invoice(s) attached and sent to the Treasurer. Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted no
          later than 30 days after the end of the budget year. The Treasurer shall verify the claim with the appropriate
          approved documents, issue the check and send it to the requestor within two weeks of receiving the completed
          request form. “Void after 60 days” shall appear on all checks to remind the payee to cash the check in time.
          Accordingly, the requestor shall deposit the check within 60 days of the check.</p>
        <p>5. Special Funds</p>
        <p>The Sheila Lai Research Grant Endowment Fund was established with the initial amount of $10,000. Interest
          from the principle is available for awards. The award amount shall not be less than $500.00. The amount may be
          a combination of the fund interest and matching donation for the award. The interest shall roll into the
          principle, when an award is not given. The Finance Committee shall decide on issues related to this fund with
          consultation of Sheila Lai, the donor (telephone number: 916-363-5509; email address: <a
            href="mailto:sheilalai@csus.edu">sheilalai@csus.edu</a>.</p>
        <p>6. Finance Committee and its Reports</p>
        <p>The Finance Committee shall submit to the Board two reports per year. The first report covers the Treasurer's
          September and December quarterly reports for the Board's review at the mid-winter meeting; the second report
          covers the Treasurer's March and June quarterly reports for the Board's review at the annual meeting. The
          report shall include review of the financial picture and make recommendations to the President and the Board
          to ensure the sound financial health of the Association. Accompanied with the report shall be an updated
          summary of the last three years' revenues and expenses. The Committee shall be certain that the Treasurer's
          reports are clear, readable, and ready for IRS review anytime. The Committee may suggest revisions of the
          financial review process for Board's approval.</p>

          <strong>GUIDELINE FOR </strong><br><strong>CALA'S FUNDRAISING AND DONATIONS DUE TO MAJOR DISASTERS</strong>
          <br><strong>Revised August 26, 2010</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>PRELUDE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) is a nonprofit organization with a tax-exempt status under
          Section 501( C ) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
        </p>
        <p>
          CALA's chief source of income is derived from membership dues and fundraising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two of the CALA's objectives are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To promote Sino-American librarianship and library services in the United States and the exchange with
            China.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide a vehicle whereby Chinese American librarians may cooperate with other associations or
            organizations having similar interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Apparently because of recent global warming, more and more serious natural disasters around the world had
          caused enormous casualties, and heavily damaged or destroyed buildings, including libraries and homes,
          resulting in great losses of personal properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a professional organization, CALA has been responding and making donations to several disaster relief funds
          during the past decade, such as those for the 9.21 Earthquake in Taiwan in 1999, the Tsunami of Indonesia in
          2004, the Hurricane Katrina of New Orleans in 2005, the 5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake in China in 2008, and the 8.8
          Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan in 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of specific fundraising and donations due to major disasters is to aid in alleviating the catastrophic
          damage to libraries and librarians particularly in the areas of the U.S. and China.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>DEFINITION AND EXAMPLES OF CATASTROPHIC LEVEL OF DISASTERS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Disasters are at the catastrophic level if they destroy the entire or major portions of villages or towns.
          Sample catastrophes are caused by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Earthquakes (magnitudes of 7.0 in the Richter scale and up)</li>
          <li>Floods (including on the Saffir-Simpson Scale Category 5, super typhoons at 10 or higher degrees,
            snow-storms, and tsunamis)</li>
          <li>Wildfires.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>CALL FOR DISASTER DONATION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The call for a fundraising and donation to assist a disastrous area's Library Association will come from the
          President, if the occasion so warrants. This President must have the prior approval of the Board of Directors
          for such an action. The President will set up a Taskforce on Donations Due to Disasters, to ensure that a CALA
          Relief Fund is established and the project is completed smoothly. Such a call will be limited to <strong>no
            more than once a year.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CALA DISASTER RELIEF FUND</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Call for Donations, CALA board may contribute towards the CALA Relief Fund a maximum of US $1,000.00
          from the affordable CALA General Fund Account. Together with other donated funds for this relief, the CALA
          Relief Fund will be donated to librarians or libraries affected by the catastrophe. Such a donation will be
          limited <strong>to no more than once a year.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>GIFT</strong><strong> BOOKS/MATERIALS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Gift books and equipments or other materials will be accepted when sufficient funds to cover the cost of
          shipping and handling to designated library or libraries. These gifts become the properties of the receiving
          library or libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>USE OF CALA DISASTER RELIEF FUND</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each receiving library who receives the CALA Disaster Relief Fund may use the fund to purchase books,
          journals, equipment, or materials for rebuilding their library collections. These materials may be marked with
          appropriate bookplates referring them as CALA's gifts. This process will be coordinated by each disaster
          Taskforce with the CALA counterpart Library Association or with each individual library.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CALA COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTERPART LIBRARY ASSOCIATION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chair of the Taskforce will communicate and work with the counterpart Library Association in the affected
          area, in order to gather information and to assist in the distribution of the Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CALA TREASURER</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Treasurer is responsible for monitoring the CALA General Fund Account for annual expenditures, and for
          informing the Board whether there is enough money available for the Association to make a donation. The
          Treasurer is also responsible for receiving and recording the dates of donations, donors, and amount into the
          CALA's Account database. The CALA President will designate another member to receive incoming donations in
          case the Treasurer is not available. The President, Treasurer, and Taskforce Chair should work closely
          together, so that acknowledgements and receipts can be sent out to donors on a timely basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>COMMITMENT TO DONORS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          CALA ensures that all donations received (minus handling charges made by Pay-Pal) will be fully used for the
          established purpose. CALA must ensure the incoming and the outgoing Relief Fund have total transparency. List
          of donors and the amount received will be reported to the CALA Board by the Taskforce Chair. (List of donors
          will also be acknowledged on the CALA Listserv, CALA Web, and CALA Newsletter.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>THANK YOU LETTERS AND RECEIPTS FOR DONORS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          An official <em>Thank Your Letter</em> and an official <em>CALA Receipt</em> stating the date, fund, and
          amount donated to the Relief Fund will be sent to each donor by the Taskforce Chair, working in concert with
          the Treasurer (for the <em>Receipts</em>), the President and the Executive Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>REPORTS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chair of the Taskforce should submit semiannual reports to the President and the Executive Director for
          the Board. These reports should include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The list of donors and the total amount of money received for the purpose.</li>
          <li>The distribution of the donation when available.</li>
          <li>The response from the counterpart Library Association.</li>
          <li>An assessment of the project at the end of the task.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Donations may be extended to those seriously affected by disasters out of the range of "natural disasters".
          The Board should discuss such incidents on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Individual accidents that happen to CALA members, including student members, should be dealt with at the
          local Chapter level.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Taskforce requests the Board to approve this document titled <strong><em>GUIDELINE FOR CALA'S
              FUNDRAISING AND DONATIONS DUE TO DISASTERS.</em></strong>

        <p class="text-center">Submitted by CALA International Relations Committee in December, 2011</p>
        <p class="text-center">Approved by CALA Board in January 2012</p>
        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>The Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) joined the International Federation of Library
          Associations and Institutions (IFLA) as a national association member effective September 2011. CALA's IFLA
          membership number is US-0009. As a national association member, CALA automatically belongs to Management of
          Library Associations (Section 40). CALA also belongs to the following sections: Information Literacy
          (Section 42) and Library Services to Multicultural Populations (Section 32). (IFLA Section list can be found
          at <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623213945/http://www.ifla.org/en/activities-and-groups#list4">http://www.ifla.org/en/activities-and-groups#list4</a>).
        </p>
        <p>The IFLA Statutes state that only member associations and institutions can nominate individuals for
          committee appointments, and that those organizations can nominate an individual only if that organization
          belongs to the IFLA section to which the individual is being nominated. As an association member of IFLA,
          the Chinese American Librarians Association nominates representatives to IFLA standing committees. The CALA
          International Relations Committee (CALA IRC) reviews the names of those nominated or self-nominated and
          recommends to the CALA Board for the final nominations to IFLA. The procedures outlined below are used for
          identifying candidates for CALA Board endorsement.</p>
        <h5>Terms of appointment</h5>
        <p>IFLA calls for nominations to standing committees every two years, in the fall of an odd numbered year
          (e.g., calls for nominations go out in the fall of 2007 for a term beginning in 2009; 2009 for a term
          beginning in 2011, etc.). This means that the CALA International Relations Committee must have their
          nominees identified and ready to send to the CALA Board by the end of the corresponding even numbered years
          no later than the CALA Annual conference.</p>
        <p>An IFLA committee member serves for a four-year term. The committee member can then be reappointed for a
          second four-year term.</p>
        <p>An individual can serve for only two consecutive four-year terms on one of the IFLA committees to which
          CALA belongs.</p>
        <h5>Criteria for Selection</h5>
        <p>The CALA International Relations Committee recommends an individual for an IFLA committee appointment to
          the CALA Board. The CALA IRC should evaluate individuals based on the following criteria at the point of
          placing their names in nomination for an IFLA standing committee.</p>
        <p>Required</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The representative shall be a CALA member in good standing.</li>
          <li>
            The representative satisfied IFLA requirements for nomination to an IFLA standing committee.</li>
          <li>
            The representative should have a knowledge of at least one working language of IFLA (English is a working
            language) and should have reasonable expectation of attending meetings of the standing committee without
            cost to IFLA.</li>
          <li>
            If appointed, the CALA representative must fully participate in the IFLA committee’s annual meetings and
            conferences. A timely report must be submitted to CALA IRC and CALA Newsletter for broad dissemination.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the appointed individual is not able to serve the committee capacity, CALA IRC will recommend other
            individuals to the CALA Board to fill in the gap.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Desired</p>
        <p>The following are not listed in priority order. They are meant merely to provide general guidance.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Should be fully conversant with the theories underlying the area in question.</li>

        <li><strong>Authority</strong> This CALA LISTSERV POLICY shall govern the terms of the CALA LISTSERV, to the extent that such terms do not contradict with CALA’s other governing documents, and in such case, the terms of the CALA LISTSERV POLICY shall be subordinate to those other contradictory terms</li>
        <li><strong>CALA LISTSERV</strong></li>
		  <ul>
		    <li><strong>a. Name</strong> The name of this LISTSERV shall be the ‘CALA LISTSERV’.</li>
		    <li><strong>b. Purpose</strong> The purpose of the CALA LISTSERV shall be to disseminate CALA related information to the CALA LISTSERV members, and to facilitate the exchange of professional information and to stimulate conversations and dialogues via an electronic forum.</li>

		    <li><strong>e. LISTSERV Administration</strong> At all times there shall be an active administrator in charge of the CALA LISTSERV. This Administrator, a member of the Web Committee, shall be responsible for maintaining the functionality of the CALA LISTSERV, which duties include, but are not limited to:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>i. authorizing new CALA LISTSERV membership</li>
					<li>ii. removing inappropriate or unauthorized communications</li>
					<li>iii. maintaining an active internet domain or domain name</li>
					<li>iv. removing unauthorized users</li>
					<li>v. removing users for violating Rules of Etiquette</li>

					<li>ix. maintaining and updating the subscribers’ lists</li>
					<li>x. censuring messages not complying with the CALA LISTSERV POLICY or the CALA MISSION</li>
				</ul>
		    <li><strong>f. Rules of Etiquette</strong> CALA LISTSERV and its members shall conduct their LISTSERV communications pursuant to the following Rules of Etiquette:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>i. Members shall not collect names or email addresses, also known as “harvesting,” to be used for contacting any list subscriber outside of the CALA LISTSERV. Members names and email addresses should be used for the CALA LISTSERV and CALA related purposes only</li>
					<li>ii. Members shall extend the same professional courtesies in their electronic LISTSERV communications as they would in appropriate, non-electronic communications.</li>
					<li>iii. Members shall not intentionally challenge or attack other LISTSERV members. The purpose of the CALA LISTSERV is to promote the exchange of professional information and to stimulate conversations and dialogues consistent with CALA’s general purpose. M embers shall not generate contentious communications, but shall be respectful of other members’ opinions and thoughts.</li>
					<li>iv. Members shall not post commercial messages or solicitations of any kind, whether on behalf of an individual, a member, or entity.</li>
					<li>v. Members shall not send repetitive messages and shall not be duplicitous in their communications. This is commonly known as “spamming”.</li>
					<li>vi. Members shall exercise professional judgment in their comments. Information posted on the CALA LISTSERV is available for members and others, and as such, postings should be regarded as non-private in this regard only, subject to slander and libel liabilities.</li>
					<li>vii. Members shall not use defamatory, abusive, profane, threatening, offensive, or illegal materials, and said use is strictly prohibited.</li>
					<li>viii. Members shall not post any message content that would otherwise be inappropriate for general public communication or discussion.</li>
					<li>ix. CALA LISTSERV, its Administrator or CALA Board of Directors may create sub-listservs within the CALA LISTSERV, and members of sub listservs shall post communications only to the most appropriate listserv(s).</li>
					<li>x. Members shall not use the CALA LISTSERV to campaign for candidates in CALA due to conflict of interest.</li>
					<li>xi. Members shall state in the subject line of the communication, concisely and clearly, the specific topic of the communication.</li>
					<li>xii. Members shall include only the relevant portions of the original message in their replies. Members shall delete any header information, and shall put their responses before the original posting.</li>
					<li>xiii. Members shall only send communications, or ‘reply-all’ when the information contained therein is appropriate for all members.</li>
					<li>xiv. Members shall send messages such as “thanks for the information,” “Congratulations” or “me too” to individual authors, not the entire CALA LISTSERV list. This can be accomplished by forwarding the communication to the particular recipient.</li>
					<li>xv. CALA members shall communicate to the Web Committee and/or Membership Committee for their email changes.</li>
					<li>xvi. Members shall warn other members of lengthy communications by inserting language in the subject line of the message, for example “Long Message”.</li>
					<li>xvii. Members shall not include non-LISTSERV members as recipients of a message of this LISTSERV. In such an instance, the LISTSERV Administrator will withhold the message until proper approvals of membership and content are met.</li>					
				</ul>			
		    <li><strong>g. Conditions</strong> The following additional terms and conditions apply to the CALA LISTSERV:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>i. Membership to the CALA LISTSERV is a privilege, not a right, and all members, as a condition of membership, agree to abide by the terms and conditions of this CALA LISTSERV Policy.</li>
					<li>ii. CALA LISTSERV members can post content via their registered emails to the list. It’s the nature of a listserv that any postings sent from a non registered email are subject to be reviewed and approved by the LISTSERV administrator.</li>
					<li>iii. It is free for LISTSERV members to post their libraries’ job advertisements. However, we encourage members to use the CALA Ads Service to promote their jobs widely.</li>
					<li>iv. CALA Board of Directors or the LISTSERV Administrator may, from time to time, approve the posting of advertisements, job offers, internship opportunities, grant opportunities, and similar by non-LISTSERV members, and in such a case, CALA may charge a fee for such posting.</li>
					<li>v. Membership may be revoked at any time and for any reason, and each member hereby agrees to waive any and all recourse as a result of such CALA LISTSERV membership revocation.</li>
					<li>vi. This CALA LISTSERV Policy may be changed or amended from time to time by the CALA Board of Directors, and subsequent changes or modifications shall be binding upon the membership. CALA will publish any subsequent changes promptly after said changes occur.</li>
					<li>vii. CALA is not responsible for the content of postings or communications on the CALA LISTSERV, and members, as a condition of granting membership to the CALA LISTSERV, hereby agree to hold harmless CALA and its affiliates for any and all liabilities accruing as a result of the CALA LISTSERV and any and all communications related thereto.</li>
					<li>viii. CALA and the CALA LISTSERV members hereby agree to be governed by the laws of the state of Illinois, and to adjudicate any disagreements within the state of Illinois.</li>
					<li>ix. If any provision of this CALA LISTSERV Policy is deemed illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, then said provision shall be stricken and the remaining terms of this CALA LISTSERV Policy shall remain in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law.</li>
