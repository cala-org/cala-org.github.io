        <ul>
          <li>Candidates should reach out to the CALA Executive Committee (EC) by the end of January in the year they
            seek election if they are running for President within the American Library Association (ALA) and within the
            International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA).</li>
          <li>Each person seeking an endorsement for ALA president should send the CALA EC a short biography,
            political/platform statement, resume/CV and be open to do a virtual interview with all CALA members via an
            online program like Zoom or Google Meet. All other candidates seeking endorsement for other
            offices/committees can send a resume/CV and a short biographical statement to the CALA EC.</li>
          <li>CALA EC will make the decision/vote for endorsement. To gain an endorsement, a candidate must get the
            majority vote from CALA EC.</li>
          <li>Endorsements are given out on a voluntary/non-monetary basis and it is not mandatory that an endorsement
            is given every year. Endorsements are awarded at the discretion of CALA EC. If CALA EC does not find any
            candidates worthy of a political endorsement, they can decide not to endorse any political candidates in a
            given year.</li>
          <li>Generally, CALA EC has only endorsed candidates for ALA President and IFLA President and Governing Board
            Members. CALA EC is open to endorsing candidates running for other types of library/information
            science/archives-related offices, excluding CALA election, union elections and cases where people in
            academic positions seek individual tenure.</li>
          <li>If anyone seeking an endorsement is (1) part of the CALA EC, or (2) have conflict of interest with any of
            the candidates (relative, romantic or business partner, supervisor/employee, etc.),  that person must recuse
            themselves from the endorsement discussion and vote.</li>
          <li>Any other non-library/information science/archive related political offices (such as state and municipal
            government races, Board of Education, academic tenure, etc.) or political offices related to our fellow
            national associations of librarians of color (the Black Caucus of the American Librarians Association/BCALA;
            REFORMA: The National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish
            Speaking; the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association; the American Indian Library Association/AILA)
            and/or the Joint Council of Librarians of Color (JCLC), will not be under consideration for CALA
            endorsement.</li>
          <li>It is not mandatory for political candidates to be CALA members to seek the organizations’ endorsement,
            however membership and service to the organization would be seen favorably.</li>
          <li>Once the CALA EC gets the names of political candidates who are running for office and seeking CALA
            endorsement, the CALA President will verify  the list of names  with  the CALA Membership Committee to
            confirm membership status of the candidates.</li>
          <li>Endorsement will be a public statement of support from CALA via a press release that will be posted on the
            CALA website and social media channels. There are no monetary campaign contributions or volunteer campaign
            work associated with an endorsement. CALA EC will write and publish the press release.</li>
          <li>Individual CALA members who wish to contribute their own volunteer time and funds to a political campaign
            may do so as long as they do not imply they are acting as an official representative/or on behalf of CALA.
          </li>
          <li>Ideally, CALA EC will make their political endorsement announcement by the end of February or early March
            for the ALA presidential race. Announcements of endorsement for other political offices will be determined
            by CALA EC depending on the election timeline of the other political races.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h6">Minimum candidate standard requirements:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be running for office within the American Library Association or related affiliates. Other
            library/information science/archive-related political elections would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
          </li>
          <li>Agree with CALA’s mission and vision and candidates must state how they are supporting/doing the work in
            their candidate statement and interview.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate commitment/support for the Chinese and Chinese American communities and Asian American and 
            Pacific Islander communities at large. Candidates do not necessarily have to be of Chinese heritage.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate commitment/support for diversity at large within the library/ information science/archives
            profession.</li>
          <li>For candidates seeking ALA presidential office, they must demonstrate a strong background  of  leadership
            and management experience.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate integrity, character and good communication skills.</li>
          <li>Active volunteering/involvement in other library/information science/archives-related groups or civic and
            community organizations, or diverse/multicultural institutions or organizations will be looked at favorably.

          CALA Endowment Fund is to secure CALA and its future operation. The CALA $100,000
          endowment fund will be invested into a carefully selected mutual fund approved by EC and
          Board. In any good year, 5% of the earnings will be reinvested into the principal. The 5%
          reinvestment to the principal is to keep the fund with the inflation and with the fluctuation of
          the market, especially for any year that has a downside. The remaining earnings can be used for
          operation or scholarship use. This is recommended according to literature regarding
          endowment funds managed by non-profit organization. The bank should be instructed to return
          the 5% of the earnings into the principal and the remaining earnings into a separate account.
          This account can be cash reserve or the same mutual fund.

        <p class="text-end">Amended June 24, 2018, by the Board of Directors</p>
        <p>The Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA, <a href="https://cala-web.org">https://cala-web.org</a>),
          a non-profit organization with 501(c)3 tax exempt status, recognizes the importance of maintaining a healthy
          status both strategically and financially. This policy establishes a general investment guideline for the
          relevant endowment funds that are used to support CALA’s operational and awarding activities.</p>
        <p>The Board of Directors has a direct oversight role regarding all decisions that impact CALA’s organizational
          funds. The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors (EC) is entitled by the CALA Constitution to possess
          all authority of the Board to act between board meetings, except with respect to the following three matters –
          (1) actions requiring general membership approval, (2) amendment or repeal of any portion of the Bylaws, and
          (3) amendment of any resolution of the Board unless so authorized by the Board. EC has the delegated
          supervisory responsibility for the management of CALA funds.</p>
        <p>In accordance with CALA’s understanding and support of Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds
          Act<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> (UPMIFA), investment decisions must be
          considered along with the status and mandate of CALA. The investments will preserve the purchasing power of
          the principal of the endowment funds in the future.&nbsp; The Executive Committee shall manage and invest
          CALA’s funds in good faith and with the care that an ordinarily prudent body in a like position would exercise
          under similar circumstances. In making decisions relative to the investment of organizational funds, each of
          the following factors must be considered:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>general economic conditions;</li>
          <li>possible effect of inflation or deflation;</li>
          <li>expected tax consequences, if any, of investment decisions or strategies;</li>
          <li>diversified portfolio of investment options;</li>
          <li>expected total return from the income and appreciation of investments;</li>
          <li>the needs of the organization and the fund to make distributions and preserve capital; and,</li>
          <li>an asset’s special relationship or special value, if any, to the organization’s purposes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For each decision to do with appropriate organizational funds for investment or expenditure, a written
          approval record by the EC and Board of Directors shall be kept and maintained describing the investment
          proposal, discussion, and the voting results, including voting members and date.</p>

        <p>When any such interest become relevant to any subject requiring action by the Board of Directors or any of
          its committees, the Board member having a conflict shall call it to the attention of the Board or the
          committees. The Board member shall not vote on the subject in which the member has a conflict of interest;
          shall not use personal influence; and in those cases where the quorum of the meeting is called for the purpose
          of voting on the subject has not been established, the Board member shall not be counted.</p>
        <p>If excluded from voting because of a conflict of interest, the Board member will be required to briefly state
          the nature of the conflict, and may be requested to answer pertinent questions of other Board members when
          that Board member’s knowledge of the subject will assist the Board or any of its committees. The Board may
          request that a Board member thus excluded from voting on a subject leave the meeting temporarily while the
          subject is debated and voted upon. The minutes of the meeting shall reflect that a disclosure was made, that
          the Board member who stated a conflict of interest did abstain from voting, and, in those cases where the
          quorum was not already established, that the Board member was not counted in determining the quorum.</p>
        <p>Unless specified excluded by an award, election, or grant, all members defined under “eligibility” shall be
          permitted to apply. If nominated as a candidate, a voting member should recuse oneself following
          aforementioned protocols.</p>
        <p>In addition, if any Board member, who by reason of his or her institutional affiliation or any other
          pertinent matter, anticipates that in the future certain issues to be placed before the Board may place him or
          her in a position of conflict of interest, the Board member shall disclose such conflict in writing to the
          Board and make it a matter of record.</p>
