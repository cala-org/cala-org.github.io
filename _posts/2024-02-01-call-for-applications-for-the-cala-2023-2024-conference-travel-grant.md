Dear CALA Members,

We are delighted to inform you that the CALA Conference Travel Grant Subcommittee is currently accepting applications for the 2023-2024 Conference Travel Grant. This year, there are *16 grants* available for CALA members.

The purpose of this travel grant is to support CALA members in their professional and career development by facilitating their active participation in professional conferences.

Since there will now not be a World Library and Information Conference in 2024, the Executive Committee has decided to increase the amount of travel grant funding for *10 CALA members to attend the 2024 ALA Annual Conference ($1000/person).* Additionally, there will be *6 travel grants for CALA members to attend library conferences hosted in China ($500/person)*. For library conferences hosted in China, the funding can be used to cover conferences held up till **December 31, 2024**. Upon approval of the recommendation by CALA's Executive Committee and the announcement on the CALA list, each recipient will receive a check from the CALA Treasurer upon the submission of the conference report.
