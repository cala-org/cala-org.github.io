Dear CALA members,



The CALA Executive Committee and the CALA Social Media Subcommittee have drafted the CALA Code of Conduct (adapted from ALA). CALA EC has approved this CALA Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct has been in the works for a little while now. 



This Code of Conduct applies to all CALA virtual and in person spaces. You can read the Code of Conduct here on our [website (under Policy/About)](https://cala-web.org/about/) as well as below. This Code of Conduct is effective immediately.

\
Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions. 



Thank you,

Ray Pun

CALA President 2022-2023

CALA CODE OF CONDUCT*

Last Updated: May 19, 2023

# PURPOSE



The goal of this CALA Code of Conduct is to establish a culture of professional, courteous, respectful, and inclusive communication among all participants on all online platforms including social media (Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, YouTube, and LinkedIn) used by CALA. We are each responsible for the content we post on these platforms. (This Code of Conduct complements the [ALA Virtual Meeting Code of Conduct](https://2021.alaannual.org/general-information/ala-virtual-meeting-code-conduct), which applies to professional conferences and meetings held by ALA.) CALA also has a Listserv Policy, [see here](https://retired.cala-web.org/files/docs/CALA-listserv-policy-v.2022.7.22.pdf). 

# RULES

Harassment is unacceptable and includes, though is not limited to, comments, non-verbal expressions, or imagery that demeans or disparages a person or group based on:

* race, ethnicity, or native language
* sex, gender, gender identity or expression
* language
* sexual orientation
* physical or mental disability
* physical appearance, body size, or presentation
* age
* religious or political beliefs, including lack of religious beliefs
* marital or family status
* nationality, citizenship status, or geographic location
* employment or military status
* socioeconomic status

Posts featuring sexual, violent, or discriminatory content are prohibited.

Intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, inappropriate physical or virtual contact, or unwelcome attention, including sexual attention are not permitted.

Respect intellectual property and give credit where it is due. It is the user’s responsibility to obtain permission for any material they post that is not their own. Please include copyright notices where appropriate, ask for creator information where unknown, and be prepared to include credits if they are found after you post.\
\
No endorsement or any promotion of any local, state, or federal candidates for political office is allowed. Neither is encouraging boycotts. These limits are because of IRS restrictions for tax-exempt organizations; detailed information can be found on the [ALA Legal Framework page](http://www.ala.org/aboutala/governance/legalguidelines/legalframework/alalegalframework).\
\
Promotion of paid products, events, or services not initiated by the Chinese American Librarians Association is not allowed. CALA is an affiliate of the American Library Association (ALA) and follows ALA practices. We encourage the sharing of nonpaid opportunities that may benefit the community. However, we ask that you do not spam. Be conscious of the number of times that you share the same opportunity and be thoughtful of the number of communities where this information is shared. When sharing your opportunity, we ask that you not just aim for reach within our community but also seek to ensure that your opportunity matches the specific needs of that community’s members.

Post as yourself. Do not impersonate any other people or entities that you are not affiliated with.

# GUIDELINES 

Foster useful and dynamic discussions and engage in a respectful dialogue. Accept critique and offer it constructively; approach discussions with an open mind and be willing to learn. Thousands of people may eventually see the messages you post, which may stay online in perpetuity and be seen by colleagues, employers, and patrons alike.

Respect freedom of expression. We encourage spirited discussion and debate. Disagreeing with an idea is different from attacking an individual, especially since discussion topics can sometimes be challenging. We encourage genuine inquiry that can build trusting relationships and a safe, respectful, and supportive environment, even in times of complex change. Every member is on an individual journey of education and understanding, and should communicate candidly and respectfully about difficult topics. Be willing to acknowledge privileges and to learn from the community.

Consider and take responsibility for the impact of communications. Impact matters more than intent, especially when the absence of nonverbal cues or voice tone means that statements (humor in particular) can easily be interpreted as aggressive or negative.

Listen as much as you share and remember that other participants may have expertise you are unaware of. Make sure conversations are inclusive, and practice active listening.

When you see content that is problematic, you may address it either publicly or privately. Acknowledge that your response is part of a respectful discussion. Pointing out factually erroneous or offensive comments keeps the space safe and helps build a stronger community. These are opportunities to educate – and to learn. In addition, if conversations continue and become out of scope or topic, please take the conversation offline. 

Speak from your own experience and avoid making generalizations. If you’re not sure whether something is correct, you can ask the community for resources.

Respect other people's pronouns – often seen in their profile or signature – preferred names, and forms of address. Consider using gender-neutral collective nouns/pronouns when addressing groups. For example, try “everyone” or “folks” instead of “guys.”

Share inspiring content. You are encouraged to share content that uplifts and explores the profession. For instance, news stories about events, examples of successful library programming, and strategies for troubleshooting are appreciated.

# WHERE TO GO FOR HELP

If you think you have seen activity that violates the letter or the spirit of this Code of Conduct, please alert our CALA social media subcommittee at [smedia@calaweb.org](mailto:smedia@calaweb.org) or CALA Executive Committee: [exc@cala-web.org](mailto:exc@cala-web.org) or members of the CALA Executive Committee directly. 

Anonymous reports are allowed. Please note that anonymous reporting may limit moderators’ ability to fully respond to conflicts, particularly if it prevents follow-up. 

# WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN REPORTING

Moderators will reach out to both the user reporting the incident and the user reported upon, but confidentiality may prevent moderators from sharing details of an issue’s resolution. Moderators may delete content that violates the Code of Conduct and in extreme cases may temporarily suspend access for violators prior to making a decision about an incident. The severity of the offense will dictate the ramifications including full suspension from a platform or platforms.

The Code of Conduct will be used equitably. Different situations will require different resolutions; moderators will give significant weight to context and impact when making decisions. They will strive to prioritize accountability and depending on the wishes of the individuals involved in an incident. If violators are suspended, the length of the suspension will be clearly described in writing.

Anyone involved in an incident may appeal a decision by sending an email to the CALA Executive Committee: [exc@cala-web.org](mailto:exc@cala-web.org). Appeals must be submitted within 60 days of the date the moderators’ decision was communicated, and must describe the reason for the appeal and why the decision should be changed. The CALA Executive Committee will oversee the appeal process.
