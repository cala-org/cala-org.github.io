Dear CALA members,

 

On behalf of the CALA Executive Committee and Board of Directors, we are excited to announce a new CALA Chapter - the Asia-Pacific (AP) Chapter which covers Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asian Countries.

 

After several discussions and approval, we are excited to see this chapter come into fruition under the leadership of Katherina Lee (the inaugural AP Chapter President & member of CALA Board of Directors). Much thanks to Katherina for starting this conversation in 2020 and for many CALA members in the past who have been in discussion for this new chapter over the past 10+ years. 

 

I would like to recognize and thank CALA Membership Committee Co-Chairs (Grace Liu and Edward Lim Junhao), CALA International Relations Committee Chair (Qinghua Xu), and the CALA Executive Committee and many Board of Directors members for gathering information and sharing input on the process and chapter proposal.

 

For those who know potential members based in the countries listed above, please encourage them to join CALA, and be part of the Asia-Pacific Chapter. 

 

Please reach out if you have any questions. 

 

Thank you,

Ray

CALA President 2022-2023
