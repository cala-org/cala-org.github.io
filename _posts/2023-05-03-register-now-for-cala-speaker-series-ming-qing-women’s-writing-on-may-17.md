Dear colleagues,



We are thrilled to announce the final event of the CALA Speaker Series. On May 17th, from 10:30 am to 11:30 am (PST), we will be joined by Dr. Grace S. Fong, Professor of Chinese Literature and R.C. & E.Y. Lee Chair in Chinese Cultural Studies at McGill University. Grace has dedicated much of her career to exploring the potential of developments in digital humanities for new modes of critical inquiry in the domain of literary studies. During her presentation, Grace will introduce the fascinating Ming Qing Women’s Writings digital archive and database project ([https://digital.library.​mcgill.ca/mingqing/](https://digital.library.mcgill.ca/mingqing/)). The Ming Qing Women’s Writings project provides open access to digitized images and searchable data of women's literary collections and anthologies from Late Imperial China for research on women’s history and culture. In her presentation, Grace will provide insight into the background of this project, discuss how it can be used to fit various research goals, share her future plans for this project, and explain how to contribute to this valuable database. 



This event is an incredible opportunity for those interested in Chinese literature, digital humanities, and women’s history and culture to learn from one of the field's most esteemed scholars. We invite you to join us for this final event of the CALA Speaker Series and participate in a Q&A session with Grace. The webinar is open to all. Please [RSVP](https://sdsu.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_4tHtBl6oSdSOT0-N5107VQ) here. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us. We look forward to seeing you on May 17th.



Sincerely,

Greta Heng
