This webinar highlights the experiences of the Chinese diaspora in Latin America. Doctoral student Laura De Moya-Guerra will focus on research collections and archives of the Chinese diaspora in Latin America, especially in Colombia. This webinar is open to all and is presented by the Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) and REFORMA: The National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking. This webinar will be recorded. 

Speaker: Laura De Moya-Guerra is a History PhD student at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. She received an MA in history and a BA in political science from the Universidad del Norte (Barranquilla, Colombia). Her research and topics of interest cover migrations and diasporas in Colombia in the 20th century. Her first project studied the Arab migration to Barranquilla in the first half of the last century. Her current research explores the Chinese diaspora in Colombia. Beginning with the separation of Panama in 1903 and culminating in Colombia's recognition of the one-China policy in 1980, Laura’s project asks for the arrival of Chinese immigrants, the establishment of aid societies, the businesses they undertook, and their relationship with the host society. Laura has publications ranging from academic articles to blog posts. In the same way, she has participated in spaces with different audiences where she has exposed her research.
