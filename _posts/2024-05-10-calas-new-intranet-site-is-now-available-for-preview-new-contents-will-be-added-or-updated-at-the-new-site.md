The Digital Services Evaluation (DSE) Taskforce and Web Committee are pleased to announce that the newly revised Intranet website is now available for members to preview. The revision is based on the feedback the DSE Taskforce collected in early 2023 and a usability test conducted by the DSE Taskforce in early 2024. This new site will become the next version of the CALA website (https://cala-web.org),  so announcements or news will be added to the new site only during this preview time.

We would appreciate it if you could take time from your busy schedule to visit the site and give us feedback by 5/31/2024.

Intranet URL: [https://cala.wildapricot.org](https://cala.wildapricot.org/)

Sincerely,

Weiling Liu

On behalf of The Digital Services Evaluation (DSE) Taskforce (2023-24) and Web Committee (2023-24)
