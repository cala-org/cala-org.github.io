Dï»¿ear CALA members,

As June comes to a close, I look forward to serving as CALA president (2023-2024) starting on July 1, 2023. Thank you everyone for your support and willingness to serve on CALA committees and taskforces.  You all make my job easy as I fill the spots for committees and taskforces. You can now view the committee assignment through the membership management system at https://cala.wildapricot.org/committees. Committee chairs will reach out to you soon, so watch out for your email.

Thank you again, and I look forward to another wonderful year!

Sincerely,

Vincci Kwong

2022-2023 CALA Vice-President
