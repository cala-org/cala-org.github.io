The CALA's IFLA membership code is US-0009. 

We are looking for 10 final recipients among all qualified applicants. Each recipient will receive a check of $800 from the CALA Treasurer after attending the 2023 IFLA conference. The CALA's Executive Committee will approve the recommendations made by the subcommittee and announce the final recipients to the CALA listserv in early May.
