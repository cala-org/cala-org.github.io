This presentation by Adam Brookes covers his latest book: 'Fragile Cargo: The World War II Race to Save the Treasures of China's Forbidden City'. "Spring 1933: The silent courtyards and palaces of Peking’s Forbidden City, for centuries the home of Chinese emperors, are tense with fear and expectation. Japan’s aircrafts drone overhead, its troops and tanks are only hours away. All-out war between China and Japan is coming, and the curators of the Forbidden City are faced with an impossible question: how will they protect the vast imperial art collections in their charge? A difficult and monumental decision is made: to safeguard the treasures, they will need to be evacuated." Speaker: Adam Brookes is an author of non-fiction and fiction. He lives in Takoma Park, MD.
