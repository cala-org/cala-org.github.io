Dear CALA members,

 

On behalf of the CALA Executive Committee, the Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) has endorsed Cindy Hohl, a CALA member, for the office of ALA President-Elect. Cindy is currently the director of policy analysis and operational support of the Kansas City Public Library. 



Cindy has been involved in many leadership roles including serving as President of the American Indian Library Association (AILA) in 2020-21, and has been a member of the steering committee of the Joint Council of Librarians of Color (JCLC) since 2019. Cindy would be the second Native American to serve as ALA President following the University of Texas' Loriene Roy in 2007-08. Cindy's vision and leadership in supporting library workers of color align well with the core values of CALA. 



The members of CALA are excited to have Cindy Hohl as the candidate for ALA President.  We support Cindy's candidacy because we strongly believe that Cindy is a leader with a vision, and a practitioner with high level skills necessary to deliver results. CALA gives Cindy Hohl its full and unwavering support.



ALA Elections open on March 13, 2023 and closes on April 5, 2023. [All ALA members will receive a ballot on March 13 and March 15, 2023.](https://www.ala.org/aboutala/governance/alaelection) To learn more about Cindy and her campaign, please see here: [https://​cindyforlibraries.com/](https://cindyforlibraries.com/)



Sincerely,

Ray Pun

CALA President 2022-23
