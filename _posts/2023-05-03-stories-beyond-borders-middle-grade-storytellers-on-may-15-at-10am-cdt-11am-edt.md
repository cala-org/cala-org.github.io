Hi everyone,

\
As part of the work of the [CALA/YALSA Taskforce](https://www.ala.org/yalsa/workingwithyalsa/tf#CALA/YALSA), we’re hosting a series of webinars featuring authors from the Stories Beyond Borders: A Chinese American and Diasporic Reading List. You can view our printable PDF now housed in the CALA repository (CALASYS): [bit.ly/calastoriesbeyond](http://bit.ly/calastoriesbeyond) \
\
The first webinar **Middle Grade Storytellers** will take place on **May 15th at 10am CDT / 11am EDT** and features middle grade authors Karina Yan Glaser (*A Duet for Home*), Lisa Yee (*Maizy Chen’s Last Chance*), and Wendy Wan-Long Shang (*The Secret Battle of Evan Pao*) in conversation with Taskforce member Amy Chow. Ray Pun will make opening remarks.
