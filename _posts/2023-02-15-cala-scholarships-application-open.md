The Chinese American Librarian Association (CALA) is soliciting scholarship applications from students and new librarians. CALA offers several scholarships that are open to full-time students and new librarians in the U.S. and Canada who are of Chinese descent. These scholarships are designed to encourage professional and leadership development in Chinese librarianship in the US and Canada. More information about the scholarships, including eligibility and application materials, can be found at [here](https://cala-web.org/reward/scholarship/cala/)
