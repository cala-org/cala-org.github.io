Hi everyone,



In celebration of its 50th Anniversary, the [Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA)](https://cala-web.org/) partnered with the [Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA)](https://www.ala.org/yalsa/) and collaborated with the [Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC)’s](https://www.ala.org/alsc/) Quicklists Consulting Committee to create a reading list for youth audiences centering Chinese American voices. The CALA/YALSA Taskforce is excited to release the final list called Stories Beyond Borders: A Chinese American and Diasporic Reading List. You can view the printable PDF here: <https://bit.ly/storiesbeyond>



This list features Chinese American and diasporic creators and stories for children, middle grade, and young adult audiences. [Allison Chi](https://www.allisonchi.com/) was our amazing graphic designer and [Julia Kuo](https://www.juliakuo.com/) & Roaring Brook Press generously provided the art from [Let’s Do Everything and Nothing](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250774347/lets-do-everything-and-nothing). 



We hope that you will share this reading list with your colleagues, library community, and networks. Please reach out to [crystalchenlibrarian@gmail.com](mailto:crystalchenlibrarian@gmail.com) with any questions.



Warmly,



[CALA/YALSA Taskforce](https://www.ala.org/yalsa/workingwithyalsa/tf#CALA/YALSA)
