Co-Presented by the Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) and the Association of Jewish Libraries (AJL), this webinar features author Susan Blumberg-Kason who will talk about her upcoming book, Bernardine's Shanghai Salon: The Story of Doyenne of Old China (forthcoming, Post Hill Press, November 2023). This biography of Bernardine Szold Fritz traces her experiences moving and living in Shanghai in 1929, and her perspective as a Jewish salon host who engaged with Chinese and expats "around the arts as the civil war erupted and World War II loomed on the horizon." In honor of Jewish American Heritage Month and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage month in the United States and Asian Heritage Month and Canadian Jewish Heritage Month in Canada in May, this webinar invites all AJL and CALA members to attend. This webinar will be recorded.
