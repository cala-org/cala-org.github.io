Dear colleagues,

 \
We are thrilled to announce that the Wikidata Chinese Cultural Heritage Group, in collaboration with the CALASYS Committee, will be hosting the third webinar of the CALA Speaker Series on [April 28th from 9 am to 10 am (PST)](https://sdsu.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_XJ2jXSPUTSq8iqUmnfqzTw). Our guest speaker, Haiqing Lin, Head of Technical Services at C.V. Starr East Asian Library, University of California, Berkeley will be presenting on "A Fusion of Tradition and Modernity: Chinese Publishing in the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries."

\
The mid-19th century marked a period of enlightenment in Chinese history. During this time, Chinese society underwent a transformation due to the introduction of modern civilization and Western culture and the rebuilding of traditions destroyed by social unrest. During the transformation of Chinese society, significant historical events such as the Taiping Rebellion, the influence of Western missionaries, the Westernization Movement, and the Wuxu Reform had a profound and lasting effect on book publishing. Virtually all significant developments during this period had a profound impact that shaped the industry's course. In this context, Chinese publishing emerged as a complex blend of tradition and modernity, showcasing diverse perspectives. This talk will discuss Chinese publishing's distinctive characteristics in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It will cover various aspects, such as publishing institutional arrangements, content features, printing technology, and the different forms of written Chinese, including the vernacular style. The talk will also examine the challenges and opportunities overseas Chinese studies librarians may face when dealing with Chinese publications during this period.\
