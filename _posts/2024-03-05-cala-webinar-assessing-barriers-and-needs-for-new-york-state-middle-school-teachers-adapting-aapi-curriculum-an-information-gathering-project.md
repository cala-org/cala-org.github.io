Dear CALA members,

Please join us for a special webinar on April 15: 

CALA Webinar: Assessing Barriers and Needs for New York State Middle School Teachers Adapting AAPI Curriculum: An Information Gathering Project

Date/Time: April 15, Monday, 9-10 am PT / 11-12 pm CT / 12-1 pm ET

Zoom Registration Link

Description: In the United States, we see growing legislative movements and community interests to ensure that Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) history is mandated and taught in the K-12 curriculum. While there is an increasing body of AAPI curricular material available for teachers, creating teacher buy-in to teach AAPI studies still needs to be better understood. In 2023, there were bills introduced to mandate the inclusion of Asian American and Pacific Islander History in New York's public school curriculums. Researchers and presenters from the Next Generation of Leaders, part of the Committee of 100's initiative, will highlight gaps and barriers from 6th-8th grade (middle school) teachers in New York in implementing AAPI curriculum in the classroom. The project conducted a survey and received over 1,600 responses from middle school teachers in New York about their experiences teaching AAPI curriculum. This presentation will cover essential themes and findings from this project. This webinar will be recorded and is co-sponsored by the Chinese American Librarians Association (CALA) Northeast Chapter.
