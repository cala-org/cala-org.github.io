Dear CALA members,



The 2023 China Library Annual Conference will be held in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, September 14-17, 2023. Just like previous years, I will organize and chair a CALA session at the China Library Annual Conference. Our session is about 1.5 to 2.5 hours. The theme could be "AI generated content and its potential implications to libraries." If you want to attend the annual conference and make a presentation about the theme, please let me know. I would like to know your presentation titles, your name, job title, and your affiliation in both English and Chinese by the end of Wednesday, June 7th. I need to report back to the contact person of the Library Society of China this Thursday. 



The CALA session is usually one of the most popular sessions at the China Library Annual Conference. We always attract a full house audience. You will be responsible for your travel expenses and registration fee. However, the benefit will be a presentation at national level and ample opportunities to engage with librarians in China. I look forward to hearing from you ASAP. 



Best regards,

Michael
