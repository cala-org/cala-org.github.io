Dear colleagues, 



We are thrilled to announce that the Wikidata Chinese Cultural Heritage Group, in collaboration with the CALASYS Committee, will be hosting the second webinar of the CALA Speaker Series on March 27th from 8 am to 9 am (PST). Our guest speaker, Ling Meng, Digital Collections Librarian at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries, will be presenting on "The Tse-Tsung Chow Collection of Chinese Scrolls and Fan Paintings" (collection link: [https://uwm.edu/lib-​collections/chinese-scrolls/](https://uwm.edu/lib-collections/chinese-scrolls/)).​ 



During the presentation, Ling will provide a brief introduction to the background of the collection and how it was made into a digital collection. The focus of the talk will be on how the bilingual metadata was created for cultural heritage materials. Ling’s team has published an article titled [“Multilingual metadata for cultural heritage materials: The case of the Tse-Tsung Chow Collection of Chinese Scrolls and Fan Paintings”](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EL-08-2013-0141/full/html), which examines current approaches to multilingual indexing and retrieval in digital collections and presents a model of creating bilingual parallel records that combines translation with controlled vocabulary mapping.



We invite everyone who is interested in this topic to join us for this informative session. The webinar is open to all, and we encourage you to share this invitation with your colleagues. Please [RSVP](https://sdsu.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_4F4glsFPTRu2mmdJgulQ1w) here. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us. We look forward to seeing you on March 27th.
