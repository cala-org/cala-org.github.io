Dear CALA members,

On behalf of the CALA Executive Committee, we are excited to share that **Hong Yao** and **Jia He** will be appointed as the CALA representatives for the JCLC 2026 Steering Committee. 

We thank everyone who has expressed interest. There will be a future call for committee volunteers later from JCLC that CALA members can participate in.

Thank you,
Ray Pun on behalf of the CALA Executive Committee
